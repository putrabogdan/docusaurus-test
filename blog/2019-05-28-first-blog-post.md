The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can be understood as a software application that provides a user interface for code development, testing, and debugging. It aids the organization of project artifacts that are important to the software applicationâ€™s source code.

It includes a number of tools and features that simplify and standardize development based on the programming language in which the code is written. Compiling and interpreting the program are also features of the IDEs.

Eclipse for Java programming, Microsoft Visual Studio, Android Studio for mobile app development, RStudio for R scripts, and PyCharm for Python programming are some of the most widely used IDEs.
