Popular IDE features are designed to aid developers in organising their work and resolving issues. IDEs parse code as it is written, allowing for real-time detection of problems caused by human mistakes. Developers can perform activities without switching between programs because utilities are represented by a single GUI. Most IDEs have syntax highlighting, which uses visual clues to discern grammar within the text editor.

Class and object browsers, as well as class hierarchy diagrams for some languages, are included in several IDEs. It is possible to develop apps without using an IDE, or each developer can create their own IDE by manually integrating numerous utilities with a lightweight text editor such as Vim or Emacs.

This method appeals to certain developers since it allows for extreme customization and control. However, within the workplace, the time savings, environment standardisation, and automation features of current IDEs usually outweigh other factors.

Most enterprise development teams now choose a pre-configured IDE that is best suited to their specific use case, thus the question is no longer whether to use an IDE, but which one to use.
