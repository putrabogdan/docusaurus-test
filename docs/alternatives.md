# Best IDE Alternatives 

Staying on top of the latest Integrated Development Environments (IDE) is a constant task, whether you are a seasoned developer or just learning how to code. To be honest, there is not a single best IDE for everyone. The best IDE is the one that works best for you!

## 1. Sublime Text

Sublime Text comes with built-in support for different varieties of programming and markup languages. Plugins, which are often community-built and maintained under free-software licences, allow users to extend the functionality of the system.


## 2. Webstorm
WebStorm is a JavaScript and associated technologies integrated development environment. It improves your development experience by automating routine operations and assisting you with complex tasks, just like previous JetBrains IDEs.

 

## 3. Brackets
Brackets is a source code editor geared for web development. It is free and open-source software created by Adobe Systems that is released under the MIT License and is being maintained on GitHub by open-source developers. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used to create it.
