# Top 10 IDE for Developer

Staying on top of the latest Integrated Development Environments (IDE) is a constant task, whether you are a seasoned developer or just learning how to code. To be honest, there is not a single best IDE for everyone. The best IDE is the one that works best for you!

## 1. Visual Studio 

Microsoft Visual Studio is a high-end IDE that costs anywhere from $699 and $2,900 based on edition and licensing. The many editions of this IDE can be used to create a wide range of programmes, including web applications, mobile apps, and video games.

This software package provides a variety of tools for compatibility testing, allowing you to check how your apps perform on over 300 different devices and browsers. A visual Studio is an excellent tool for both students and professionals because of its versatility.



## 2. Eclipse 

Eclipse is a free and open-source editor that can be used by both beginners and experts. The eclipse began as a Java environment, but thanks to a large number of plugins and extensions, it now provides a wide range of features. Eclipse’s standard edition includes Java and Plugin Development Tooling in addition to debugging tools and Git/CVS compatibility.

If that isn’t enough for you, there are a variety of other packages available, including tools for graphing, modeling, reporting, testing, and creating graphical user interfaces. The Eclipse Marketplace Client provides users with access to a vast collection of plugins and information created by a growing community of developers.

## 3. Atom 

Atom (A Hackable Text and Source Code Editor for Linux) is a free and open-source text and source code editor developed by GitHub. Its creators describe it as a “hackable text editor for the twenty-first century.” Atom offers a lot of features, but only a small portion of them are turned on by default.

This means you can choose how you want to work, whether you want to activate new extensions and utilise them to make substantial changes to Atom, or just open into Atom’s options and make little tweaks. Atom can be used to write a fiction book, Python code and technical documentation.
